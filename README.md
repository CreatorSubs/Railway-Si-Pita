## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

In addition, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

You can also watch bite-sized lessons with real-world projects on [Laravel Learn](https://laravel.com/learn), where you will be guided through building a Laravel application from scratch while learning PHP fundamentals.

## Agentic Development

Laravel's predictable structure and conventions make it ideal for AI coding agents like Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot. Install [Laravel Boost](https://laravel.com/docs/ai) to supercharge your AI workflow:

```bash
composer require laravel/boost --dev

php artisan boost:install
```

Boost provides your agent 15+ tools and skills that help agents build Laravel applications while following best practices.

## Deploy to Railway

Railway should build this repository with its `Dockerfile`. The container serves Laravel from `public/` and listens on Railway's injected `PORT`; do not set a fixed port or a separate start command.

Add these variables to the Railway service:

- `APP_ENV=production`, `APP_DEBUG=false`, `APP_KEY`, `APP_URL`, and a strong `OWNER_PASSWORD`
- `DB_CONNECTION=mysql`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD` copied from the Aiven service
- `SESSION_DRIVER=database`, `CACHE_STORE=database`, `LOG_CHANNEL=stderr`, and `FILESYSTEM_DISK=local`
- If Aiven requires its CA certificate, set `MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_CA_BASE64` to the base64-encoded contents of Aiven's CA certificate. The container writes it to `/tmp` and configures PDO to use it.

Generate `APP_KEY` once with `php artisan key:generate --show` and keep it unchanged between deploys. After the first deploy, run `php artisan migrate --force` once from the Railway service shell. If the Owner account does not exist yet, run `php artisan db:seed --force` once with `OWNER_PASSWORD` set. Migrations and seeders are intentionally not run automatically on every container start.

Certificate templates use Laravel's local public disk. Attach a Railway volume at `/var/www/html/storage/app/public` so uploaded templates survive container rebuilds. Aiven credentials are set in Railway and are not copied into the Docker image; `.dockerignore` excludes local `.env` files.
